<input type="checkbox" name="acs" value="External Penetration Test

Information Gathering
•	Advantage Security Technicians will perform comprehensive information gathering and data mining procedures in the public domain and targeting the subnet ranges supplied by the customer.

Asset Identification
•	This phase will execute comprehensive discovery and enumeration procedures targeting less than 20 public accessible IP addresses identified for the assessment. This effort will identify assets, listening services and applications providing a footprint of CUSTOMER’s internal PCI network as that relates to networked Point of Sales systems located on the CUSTOMER campus.

Vulnerability Discovery
•	Using the network information provided, individual devices are scanned for security vulnerabilities. A combination of commercial and public scanning tools are used to ensure comprehensive results.

Manual Vulnerability Discovery
•	In addition to automated tools, manual testing is performed for recent vulnerabilities that may not be covered yet by automated scanning tools used. This phase includes manual testing of identified applications and server components, testing of authentication and authorization controls that are in place and within the scope of the engagement provide an examination of all identified assets.

<input type="checkbox" name="acs" value="Wireless Penetration Test

Identification & Analysis
•	Advantage Technology will identify, enumerate and analyze authorized wireless infrastructure and un-authorized Access Points at the Customer’s facility. Once enumerated, this phase will provide an analysis of the traffic that is visible to users within the wireless environment based on the initial access obtained.

Penetration
•	This phase of the wireless testing will employ the use of common wireless attack methodologies to circumvent existing security mechanisms or controls protecting the Customer’s wireless network being targeted.

Exploitation 
•	Following the penetration testing and subsequent access obtained (if any), this component will provide an analysis of the security of the Customer’s assets that are accessible once attached to each of the wireless networks being examined.

<input type="checkbox" name="acs" value="Internal Penetration Test

Asset Identification
•	This phase will execute comprehensive discovery and enumeration procedures targeting up to 150 systems identified for the assessment. This effort will identify assets, listening services and applications providing a footprint of CUSTOMER’s internal network.

Vulnerability Discovery
•	Using the network information provided, individual devices are scanned for security vulnerabilities. A combination of commercial and public scanning tools are used to ensure comprehensive results.

Manual Vulnerability Discovery
•	In addition to automated tools, manual testing is performed for recent vulnerabilities that may not be covered yet by automated scanning tools used. This phase includes manual testing of identified applications and server components, testing of authentication and authorization controls that are in place and within the scope of the engagement provide an examination of all identified assets.

Exploitation
•	Consultants will attempt to exploit discovered vulnerabilities during the previous internal testing phases.
